    <h2>My favorite SciFi Books</h2>
    <p>Let’s start with books. I must admit that until recently, I have never read a SciFi book before. This will change
    now after I read Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari.</p>

    <table>
      <thead class="table-head">
        <tr>
          <th class="table-head">Book</th>
          <th class="table-head">Description</th>

          <td>
            <h3 class="left">2014 - Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind</h3>
            <p class="margin-left" class="align-left">Harari's way of summarizing the story of humankind in a
              precise, humorist and fact-based way was fascinating and it gave me so many new perspectives on my
              personal life that I was absolutely overwhelmed by him describing the past. But his way of picturing the
              future in his last chapter was mind-blowing. I already referred to the chapter in the first step of the application

              process. Harari states that we have reached a time when human beings have actually evolved into a “god-
              like status” because we start to replace the laws of natural evolution/selection with the laws of natural

              design. In the future, we will see increased biological engineering (changing the DNA), cyborg
              engineering (combination of organic and non-organic parts) and the engineering of inorganic life
              (machines with consciousness). This chapter is one of the reasons why I want to dive deeper into AI and I
              am excited about Harari’s second book “Homo Deus” that covers the future only! I got it as a birthday
            present and I will directly start reading it after having finished “Originals” by Adam Grant.</p>

    <h2>My favorite SciFi Movies</h2>
    <p>On the movie side, I have some more to show. Here are some of my favorite SciFi movies and how they
    influenced me:</p>

    <table>
      <thead class="table-head">
        <tr>
          <th class="table-head">Movie</th>
          <th class="table-head">Description</th>

        <tr>
          <td><img src="images/interstellar2.jpg" alt="Interstellar" class="img-movies" ></td>
          <td>
            <h3 class="left">2014 - Interstellar</h3>
            <p class="margin-left" class="align-left">Don’t take things for granted, change the status quo. (In this case the time that was considered as irreversible)</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="images/inception2.jpg" alt="Inception" class="img-movies"></td>
          <td>
            <h3 class="left">2010 - Inception</h3>
            <p class="margin-left" class="align-left">Amazing movie because of its complexity and open end (not knowing whether Cobb is still in level 1 dream or back in reality). It made me think a lot about the human brain. On the one hand, how powerful it became over the centuries and on the other hand, how much more unrevealed potential there still must be.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><img src="images/marsian2.jpg" alt="Marsian" class="img-movies"></td>
          <td>
            <h3 class="left">2015 - The Marsian</h3>
            <p class="margin-left" class="align-left">A really exciting and funny movie. The messages transported are more or less the maxim on which I act: Never give up, no matter how desperate the situation might be. Make the most of it! Be creative, you would be surprised what you can achieve with little input! And: You only have one life, so do something that really matters!</p>

            <h3 class="left">2009 - Avatar</h3>
            <p class="margin-left" class="align-left"> (+ Star Wars) No deeper meaning for me but just because both movies started a new era of technology in film.</p>

              that this TV series really gets into your head. Although I am a digital native and in favor of innovation, I
            think it’s good to also address the worst possible side effects of technological innovation.</p>
